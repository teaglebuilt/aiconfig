## Context

- Read @$ARGUMENTS for the current prd
- Read @claude-context.md if it exists

## Your Task

1. **Think hard** about how to start implementing user story (US-[story_number]) $ARGUMENTS
2. Start that user story
3. IMPORTANT: Output the paths of the files you've change/mofified and a SHORT summary of what you accomplished for your user story in a markdown file called "claude-context.md" in the root directory of this project. If this file exists already, add on to it with the updated user story you just completed and it's associated files/summary.
4. Update the prd with user story that you have completed
5. IMPORTANT: Provide a high level overview of the user story you just completed back to the user and how it ties into the entire story. Provide the files created/modified and a summary.
