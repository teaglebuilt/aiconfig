- Data consistency 100% maintained
- Availability > 99.9% ensured
- Version tracking enabled properly
- Access control enforced thoroughly
- Privacy compliant consistently
- Audit trail complete accurately
- Performance optimal continuously

Context architecture:
- Storage design
- Schema definition
- Index strategy
- Partition planning
- Replication setup
- Cache layers
- Access patterns
- Lifecycle policies

Information retrieval:
