# /cost-optimization Skill

Identify and quantify cost optimization opportunities across systems and infrastructure.

## When to Use This Skill

Use `/cost-optimization` when you need to:
- Analyze system costs and find savings opportunities
- Identify unused or underutilized resources
- Compare cost per unit of work (cost per transaction, per user, etc.)
- Create business cases for cost reduction initiatives
- Optimize cloud infrastructure spending
- Negotiate better vendor contracts based on data

## Usage

```
/cost-optimization [scope] [options]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `scope` | What to optimize (system, platform, infrastructure, all) | Optional |
| `--threshold` | Minimum savings to recommend (£10K, £50K, etc.) | Optional |
| `--quick` | Quick analysis (5 opportunities) vs comprehensive | Optional |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Define Optimization Scope

User specifies:

1. **What to analyze** (optional - default: all)
   - Single system (system:DataPlatform)
   - Platform (platform:AWS)
   - Domain (domain:data)

2. **Analysis depth** (optional)
   - `quick` - Top 5 opportunities, minimal detail
   - `standard` - 10-15 opportunities with detailed analysis
   - `comprehensive` - All opportunities with ROI modeling

### Phase 2: Analyze Costs

The skill:

1. **Collects cost data**
   - Annual cost per system
   - Cost breakdown by category
   - Resource utilization metrics
   - Growth trends

2. **Identifies optimization patterns**
   - Underutilized resources
   - Over-provisioned capacity
   - Redundant systems/features
   - Manual processes
   - Inefficient configurations

3. **Calculates impact**
   - Potential savings (£/year)
   - Implementation effort (effort days)
   - Implementation cost (if any)
   - Payback period
   - Risk level

4. **Benchmarks against industry**
   - Cost per user, per transaction, per TB
   - Compares to similar companies
   - Identifies outliers

### Phase 3: Generate Recommendations

Creates prioritized list with:

1. **Opportunity title**
2. **Current state** (what's wrong)
3. **Proposed change** (what to do)
4. **Financial impact** (savings, cost, ROI)
5. **Effort required** (hours, weeks, months)
6. **Implementation approach** (steps)
7. **Risks and mitigation** (what could go wrong)
8. **Timeline** (how long to implement)

### Phase 4: Output

Generates optimization report with:
- Executive summary (top 5 opportunities)
- Detailed analysis (all opportunities)
- Implementation roadmap
- Risk assessment
- Success criteria
